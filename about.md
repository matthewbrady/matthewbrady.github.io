### More Information

Origninally from the Boston area, I'm currently a junior at Yale University studying computer science and math. I'm most excited about algorithms for data analysis and machine learning, but really love any interesting problem in the applications of math, CS, or physics. 

In my free time, I play soccer and occasionally follow competitve Dota.
